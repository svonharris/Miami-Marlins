## Project Description

The goal of this project is to simulate a task you'd be asked to complete if you were hired for the Senior Front-End Software Engineer role. The project should not to be exhaustive, but to demonstrate how you approach a problem, specifically answer a high-level technical question, and how you go about formulating a response that you'd be able to review with the development team such that they can execute on it. You are welcome to make any assumptions you feel are necessary, as long as you are willing to explain them as part of the interview.

### Task

The Miami Marlins Baseball Applications team has been tasked with building an application where any member of the organization can get a quick glance of the schedule or results for all of the teamâ€™s affiliates for a given date on the calendar. To support this functionality, the team has determined it needs to build a web application that displays summaries of each of the affiliates games for a given day in the 2025 season.
